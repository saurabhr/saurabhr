### Hi there 👋

<!--
**saurabhr/saurabhr** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

This is a workspace of cognitive scientist with a Ph.D. in Psychology (Behavioral & Cognitive Neuroscience, University of Florida) who builds bridges between human cognition and modern LLM systems to make models more interpretable, robust, and human-aligned. 

His PhD research probes reality-monitoring, imagination, and metacognition in humans and
large language models — combining behavioral experiments, computational cognitive models, and deep neural network analyses.

His interests lie in creating tools that make human mental processes and generative-AI predictions more interpretable. 

Broader impacts of his work include creating cognitive test-beds with generative AI for human behavioral and cognitive processes. Leading to insights about human mental processes, Human-AI alignments, AI-safety, and machine psychology.

Do let me know how you like to decipher the enigma of the human brain!
