### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**saurabhr/saurabhr** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

My research program focuses on theoretical and applied questions on how we can characterize similarities and differences between human and artificial intelligence (AI) behavior. Both human and AI models form an internal representation of concepts, creating an internal world model that drives their behavior. How can AI learn to represent information as humans do? How can AI develop a better internal world model regarding factual accuracy, helpfulness, safety, and contextualization? I combine cognitive science, network science, and computational data modeling. Primarily, I am looking forward to understanding how information geometry parametrizes internal representations transformation in deep learning models with different RL algorithms, as understanding it will help us understand why they are effective and how they can be steered towards safer behavior. Furthermore, utilize them as statistical models to develop more accurate theoretical models of information processing in humans.
