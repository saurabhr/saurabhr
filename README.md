Iâ€™m Saurabh Ranjan, a cognitive scientist with a Ph.D. in Psychology (Behavioral & Cognitive Neuroscience, University of
Florida) who builds bridges between human cognition and modern LLM systems to make models more interpretable,
robust, and human-aligned. My PhD research probes reality-monitoring, imagination, and metacognition in humans and
large language models â€” combining behavioral experiments, computational cognitive models, and deep neural network
analyses.
