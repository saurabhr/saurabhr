### Hi there 👋

<!--
**saurabhr/saurabhr** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

This is a workspace of cognitive scientist with a Ph.D. in Psychology (Behavioral & Cognitive Neuroscience, University of
Florida) who builds bridges between human cognition and modern LLM systems to make models more interpretable,
robust, and human-aligned. His PhD research probes reality-monitoring, imagination, and metacognition in humans and
large language models — combining behavioral experiments, computational cognitive models, and deep neural network
analyses.
